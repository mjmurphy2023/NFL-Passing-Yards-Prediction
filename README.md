# NFL-Passing-Yards-Prediction 

This repository contains two projects focused on analyzing and predicting NFL passing yards. Each project uses distinct methodologies to explore the impact of various factors on passing yards, providing insights into offensive play strategies and defensive tactics.

**Project 1: NFL Passing Yards Prediction**

Overview

Project 1 employs statistical models and machine learning algorithms to predict the number of passing yards in NFL games. The project explores various features, including player statistics, team dynamics, and game conditions, to build a predictive model.

Key Features
- Comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Feature engineering to capture critical aspects influencing passing yards.
- Evaluation of multiple regression models to identify the best predictor of passing yards.

**Project 2: NFL Passing Yards Prediction (individual plays) and Causal Inference** 

Overview

Project 2 employs statistical models to predict the passing yards on individual plays and delves into causal inference to understand the effect of blitzing on passing yards. By isolating the impact of defensive strategies from other variables, this project provides a nuanced view of how blitzing influences quarterback performance and overall passing efficiency.

Key Features
- Evaluation of multiple regression models to identify the best predictor of passing yards on an individual play.
- Application of causal inference techniques to NFL play data.
- Exploration of the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) of blitzing on passing yards.
- Use of S Learner and T Learner models for robust causal analysis.
Technologies Used
- Python for data processing and analysis.
- Libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and causalml for data manipulation, statistical modeling, and machine learning.
- Jupyter Notebooks for project documentation and code presentation.
